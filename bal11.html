        <h1>Understanding the Balance Sheet.

            <h2>Understand the Components</h2>
            <p>The balance sheet is divided into three main sections:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assets</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Current Assets: Cash, accounts receivable, inventory, etc., which can be converted to cash within a year.</li>
                        <li>Non-Current Assets: Long-term investments, property, equipment, etc.Perform Ratio Analysis
                            Liquidity Ratios:
                            Current Ratio: 
                            Current Assets
                            Current Liabilities
                            Current Liabilities
                            Current Assets
                            ​
                             
                            Indicates ability to meet short-term obligations.
                            Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 
                            Total Liabilities
                            Equity
                            Equity
                            Total Liabilities
                            ​
                             
                            Shows financial leverage and risk.
                            Return on Equity (ROE):
                            Measures profitability relative to shareholders' equity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>Structure of a Balance Sheet
                The balance sheet is divided into three main sections:
                
                Assets
                Liabilities
                Equity
                The fundamental formula is:
                
                Assets
                =
                Liabilities
                +
                Equity
                Assets=Liabilities+Equity
                <li>How to Analyze a Balance Sheet
                    Liquidity: Measure short-term solvency using the current ratio or quick ratio:
                    
                    Current Ratio
                    =
                    Current Assets
                    Current Liabilities
                    Current Ratio= 
                    Current Liabilities
                    Current Assets
                    ​
                     
                    Leverage: Evaluate long-term financial stability using the debt-to-equity ratio:
                    
                    Debt-to-Equity Ratio
                    =
                    Total Liabilities
                    Total Equity
                    Debt-to-Equity Ratio= 
                    Total Equity
                    Total Liabilities
                    ​
                     
                    Efficiency: Assess asset utilization using turnover ratios (e.g., inventory turnover, receivables turnover).
                    
                    
                    <strong>Liabilities</strong>

                        <li>Non-Current Liabilities: Long-term debts like bonds payable or mortgages.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>Components of a Balance Sheet
                1. Assets
                Assets represent everything the company owns and are typically classified into:
                
                Current Assets (Short-term, convertible to cash within a year):
                
                
                Cash and cash equivalents
              
          Accounts receivable
                Inventory
                Prepaid expenses
                Marketable securities
                Non-Current Assets (Long-term, not easily converted to cash):
                
                Property, plant, and equipment (PPE)
                Intangible assets (e.g., patents, trademarks)
                Investments
                Long-term receivables
                2. Liabilities
                Liabilities are obligations the company owes to outsiders and are categorized as:
                
                Current Liabilities (Due within one year):
                
                Accounts payable
                Short-term loans
                Accrued expenses
                Current portion of long-term debt
                Non-Current Liabilities (Long-term obligations):
                
                Bonds payable
                Long-term loans
                Deferred tax liabilities
                Pension obligations
                3. Equity
                Equity represents the owners' residual interest in the company after liabilities are deducted from assets:
                
                Common Stock and Preferred Stock
                Retained Earnings: Accumulated net income that hasn’t been distributed as dividends.
                Additional Paid-In Capital
                
                Treasury Stock: Company’s own shares that have been repurchased.
               
                
                Key Features of a Balance Sheet
                Double-Entry System: Reflects the accounting equation where total assets equal the sum of liabilities and equity.
                
                Date Specific: Unlike an income statement, which covers a period, the balance sheet represents the financial position at a specific date.
                Classified Presentation: Groups similar items together for clarity (e.g., current vs. non-current).
